# Announcements
Provide the first-hand news, announcements, and updates of the project. 

Currently, we're under intense development and testing of our 1st version of the protocol, so we haven't open sourced any code repo here mainly for security reasons. We'll publish them out once we are assured that it is proper to make them public. Thanks for your understanding, and please stay tuned to our project updated. Thanks.
